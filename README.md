**A self-hosted, web-based application for cataloging physical collections of any type, built around extensible modules, strong metadata import, and full data ownership.**

Key principles:

- Web-first, mobile-friendly
- Self-hosted only (no SaaS mode)
- Extensible via modules
- Metadata-driven, not manual-entry-driven
- Long-term data ownership
